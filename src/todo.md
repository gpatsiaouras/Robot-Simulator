#TODO:
* Create RNN (with pytorch?) to obtain the weights. NO BACKPROP!
    * At least 2 layers (watch out delta t, timestep of recursion)
    * Input: 12 infrared sensors 
    * Pay attention to fitness criteria
        * Collision-free
        * Clean as much as possible
        * Go closer to walls
        * Other criteria
        * weight them for importance
* Create EA to evolve the weights of RNN
    * ???
* Design rooms (use lines or surfaces?) for experiments
* #####START REPORT
