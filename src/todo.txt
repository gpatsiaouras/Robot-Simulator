Goal of Assignment Mobile Robot
Simulator
• Allow me to move the robot
in a closed room using the
buttons of your PC’s
keyboard
• If robot collides with wall:
move robot realistically
along side of walls (without
entering the wall)
• Display values of distance
sensors as plain numbers


• Control speed of motors of
left and right wheel with
keyboard
    • W: positive increment of left wheel
    motor speed
    • S: negative increment of left wheel
    motor speed
    • O: positive increment of right wheel
    motor speed
    • L: negative increment of right wheel
    motor speed
    • X: both motor speeds are zero
    • T: positive
    increment of both
    wheels’ motor speed
    • G: negative
    increment of both
    wheels’ motor speed

TO IMPLEMENT:

-Motion model


-Sensor model

    • 12 infrared distance sensors
    (30°distance) as input to ANN
    • Model sensors as straight lines
    • Intersections with lines marking
    walls can be used as distance
    measurement
    • Limit distance measure
    • Implement 12 sensors:

    How to implement?
    1) Convert environment into local coordinate system
    of the robot
    2) Calculate virtual sensor lines starting from robot
    3) Find intersection with lines representing walls
    4) Calculate distances (center of robot to intersection
    points)
    5) Apply distance threshold
    6) Apply transformation for all distances below
    distance threshold

-Collision handling

    Collision detection and handling
    • Use bounding object (circle) for robot
    • Calculate intersection of body with all
    walls
    • Make sure that robot speed and
    simulation time step allow for detection of
    collision
    • For precise simulations calculate back
    point in time of collision
    • For collision handling, apply motion only
    parallel to wall, rest motion perpendicular
    to wall (no friction model required)

    Collision handling – moving along the wall
    • If driver moves into
    the wall, properly
    calculate velocity
    components
    perpendicular and
    parallel to wall
    • Only velocity
    parallel to wall
    contributes to
    actual motion (CHECK IMAGES IN SLIDES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND
